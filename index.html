Nina La Rosa, MS, NCC

I am a pre-licensed clinical mental health counselor specializing in mindfulness-based psychotherapy. I practice in Burlington, Vermont with individuals, couples, families, and groups. For the past five years I have trained and worked as a facilitator under internationally respected mindfulness teacher, Shinzen Young, teaching mindfulness to individuals and groups. I completed my master of science degree in clinical mental health counseling at University of Vermont in 2012. At UVM I researched multicultural issues in counseling, completed my clinical internship at Counseling Service of Addison County working with youth and families, and worked at MindBody Medicine Clinic at Fletcher Allen Health Care in clinical neuroscience research. I am interested in how the brain responds to clinical interventions such as mindfulness and use my clinical and research experience in neuroscience to inform my counseling work, especially in facilitating healing from trauma and attachment-focused therapy. I am also trained in equine-facilitated psychotherapy and greatly enjoy using the sensitive presence of horses in my practice with people of all ages and levels of horse experience.
